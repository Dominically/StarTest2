# StarTest 2

A floaty-space-galaxy-simulation-thingy that I made during 2nd year of university (and have come back to since). This is going on my website.

TODO: Insert a screenshot and maybe write a better description for this.

## Building

Requires Node.js, PNPM, and Cargo.
PNPM is especially important because it links packages locally meaning that your local modules/packages are upgraded as soon as you press save.
